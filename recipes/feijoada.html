<h1>Feijoada</h1>
This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains<br>
the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional meats, including sausage, may be added if desired.<br>
This is excellent served over brown rice.<br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4><ol>
        <p><li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic;
            cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes.<br>
            Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours,
            or until tender. </li></p>
        <p><li>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. <br>
               Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour.
               Drain and add to beans. </li></p>
        <p><li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li></p>
        <p><li>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish.
               Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes. </li></p>
        <p><li>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. 
               Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper.
               Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more. </li></p>
        <p><li>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving. </li></p>
